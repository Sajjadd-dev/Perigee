//! Fee-market / billing service.
//!
//! API-28 (Perigee): Business logic was previously living inside the HTTP
//! controllers in `main.rs`. This service exposes that logic through plain
//! async methods so the Axum handlers only do request → service → response
//! translation and error mapping.
//!
//! API-26 (Perigee): Monetary values use integer minor units (stroops =
//! 1e-7 XLM) end-to-end. Statistical ratios (confidence, volatility,
//! transaction pressure) are stored as basis points (0..=10000) so the
//! representations stay integer/deterministic. No f64 multiplications
//! are performed on fee/NAV amounts.
